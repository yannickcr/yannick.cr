My first experience with node.js was following the ‘hello world’ tutorial on the front page This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link, which I then extended to experiment with writing in Markdown and creating HTML pages on the fly. Not quite a static site generator, but a fun experiment in learning during the Mozilla Polyglot Hackathon.

## Octopress to power this site

I’m currently using Octopress to power this site as well as bmannconsulting.com (see my migration write up), but one of the things I’d like is the ability to not have to have access to my dev environment in order to publish pages. That is, right now I can create/edit Markdown files anywhere1 since my blog source is in Dropbox, but to compile / publish it, I need access to a machine that has the development environment installed.
